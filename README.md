## Description

This is a WeakAura for Paladins in Season of Discovery.
It will be shown when an enemy target is in execute range for Hammer of Wrath **ONLY** with active Improved Hammer of Wrath rune.


## Installation

Download the zip file and extract the folder "HammertimeWA" with the media files into X:Path\to**\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\**.
**Restart WoW or do /reload or /script ReloadUI(); for the client to load the new media files.**
Open WeakAuras config window and click on "Import".
Copy and paste the import string that you can find either on [Wago.io]( INSERT WAGO LINK ) or in the importstring.txt contained in the zip file to import the WeakAura.


## Customization

To add a sound file to be played when the WeakAura triggers, open the WeakAuras config window and click on the "+" button below "HAMMER TIME" and select "STOP!".
On the right side click on "Actions" and replace the string "*insert filename*" under "Sound File Path" with the file name of the sound file including file extension (i.e.: .ogg, .wav, .mp3).
Make sure to reload the WoW UI again, so the audio file gets loaded into the client.


Have fun hammering! :D
